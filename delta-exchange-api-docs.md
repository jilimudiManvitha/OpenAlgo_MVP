# Introduction

Welcome to the Delta Exchange API! You can use this API to place orders on Delta Exchange and listen to market feed.

We have language bindings in Shell, Python, Ruby and Nodejs! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

> Scroll down for code samples, example requests and responses. Select a language for code samples from the tabs above or the mobile navigation menu.

# General Information
## Definitions
  **Assets:** are cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies. Each asset has a 3/4 letter code (e.g. BTC, USDC). A derivative contract on Delta Exchange will entail multiple assets, namely:

   - **Underlying Asset:** This is the asset over which a futures or perpetual contract is defined. For e.g. the underlying asset of the BTCUSD perpetual contract is BTC. 

   - **Quoting Asset:** The asset in which price of the quoting is called the quoting asset. For e.g. the BTCUSD contract is quoted in USD. Therefore, the quoting asset of the contract is USD.
   
   - **Settling Asset:** The asset in which the margin and Profit/ Loss of a contract is denominated. For e.g. the BTCUSD contract is margined and settled in USD. Therefore, the settling asset of the contract is USD.

**Products**: are the derivative contracts listed on Delta Exchange. Each contract can be referred by either its Product ID (e.g. 27 is the Product ID of BTCUSD contract) or Symbol (BTCUSD is the symbol for BTCUSD contract). It is worth noting that Orders, Orderbook APIs expect Product IDs. 
e.g.

product_id| symbol |product_type| description
--|--|--|--
27  |BTCUSD|perpetual_futures|Bitcoin Perpetual futures margined and settled in INR
3136|ETHUSD|perpetual_futures|Ethereum perpetual futures margined and settled in INR
2000|P-BTC-38100-230124|put_options|BTC put option strike price $38100 and expiring on 23/01/2024
5000|C-BTC-55800-170224|call_options|BTC call option strike price $55800 and expiring on 17/02/2024


## Symbology

**Contract symbol:** has the following format

    Underlying Asset| Quoting Asset|_|Matruity Date (optional, applicable only for futures contracts)
    
    e.g. BTCUSD, ETHUSD

    For Options symbol:  
    Option Type |-| Underlying Asset |-| Price Strikes |-| Expiry Date in ddMMYY   
    e.g. C-BTC-90000-310125: C (Call Option) BTC (Bitcoin) 90000 strike price expiring on 31st Jan 2025
    

  
**Mark Price:** Each contract has a unique [Mark Price](https://www.delta.exchange/user-guide/)  which can be referred to by: **MARK: Contract_Symbol (MARK:BTCUSD)** 

**Index Price:** The prices of the underlying assets for the contracts listed on Delta Exchange are obtained from various spot exchanges, and are computed by averaging prices from multiple exchanges. Details of all the indices are available on this [page](https://www.delta.exchange/indices/).
  

For a given Underlying Asset/ Quoting Asset pair, the Index price symbol is: ***.DE|Underlying Asset|Quoting Asset|*** 
e.g. **.DEBNBXBT**
It is important to note that the BTCUSD Index price doesn't follow this convention as its symbol is **.DEXBTUSD**.

  
## Pagination
Pagination allows to fetch data page-wise. We use cursor based pagination where each response metadata contains a before and after cursor. The cursor needs to passed on with the next request to paginate over the result. Please note that the cursors are updated with each new page.

Pagination can be called in following APIs

API|End point|
--|--
Products|/v2/products
Orders|/v2/orders
Orders History|/v2/orders/history
Fills|/v2/fills
Wallet transactions|/v2/wallet/transactions

**Pagination parameters**

  - after 
    - after cursor to fetch the next page
  - before 
    - before cursor to fetch the previous page
  - page_size
    - page size for pagination

In API response, meta data will contain the cursors as show below

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": [],
  "meta": {
    "after": "an_arbitary_string",
    "before": "another_arbitary_string"
  }
}
```
  
**Example**

https://api.india.delta.exchange/v2/products?page_size=30

https://api.india.delta.exchange/v2/products?page_size=30&after=after_cursor_from_last_request

## Data Centers 
Delta Exchange data centers are in **AWS Tokyo**
# Authentication

Api endpoints that place orders or fetch account related information needs to authenticated using api key and api secret.



## Common Errors

### SignatureExpired Error

* ```{ "error": "SignatureExpired", "message": "your signature has expired" }```

**Explanation:**  This error occurs when the timestamp used to generate your API request signature is more than **5 seconds** old by the time it reaches Delta Exchange servers. The platform enforces this time window to prevent replay attacks. You can check server time and request time in the api error response too.

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

**1. Sync Your System Clock**

- Ensure your system time is accurate using NTP (Network Time Protocol).
  - **Linux/macOS:** `sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org`
  - **Windows:** Make sure the *Windows Time* service is running and properly synced.
- Enable automatic time synchronization in your system settings to prevent future drifts.

**2. Check Network Latency**

- Check for any network latency on your side.
- Use a stable and high-speed internet connection.

**3. Verify Timestamp Generation**

- Use Unix timestamp format (seconds since epoch).
- Don't reuse stale timestamps; update the timestamp before every request.
- Ensure the timestamp used in the signature matches the one sent in the request.
- Refer to the sample code block on the right.

```
# python code to generate signature
timestamp = str(int(time.time()))
signature_data = method + timestamp + path + query_string + payload
signature = generate_signature(api_secret, signature_data)
```

### InvalidApiKey Error

* ```{ "error": "InvalidApiKey", "message": "Api Key not found" }```

**Explanation:**  The API key in your request doesn't exist or is invalid. This can happen due to using keys from the wrong environment or deleted keys. 

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

**1. Verify the Correct Environment**

- API keys created at [Delta India](https://www.delta.exchange) account must be used only with production apis.(prod api - [https://api.india.delta.exchange](https://api.india.delta.exchange))
- API keys created at [Demo](https://demo.delta.exchange) account must be used only with testnet apis.(testnet api - [https://cdn-ind.testnet.deltaex.org](https://cdn-ind.testnet.deltaex.org))
- Please not that the api url [https://api.delta.exchange](https://api.delta.exchange) belongs to Delta Global and it can not used here. 

**2. Check API Key Validity**

- Log into Delta Exchange and confirm the key exists and is active.  
- Check for any typos in the key too.


### UnauthorizedApiAccess Error

* ```{ "error": "UnauthorizedApiAccess", "message": "Api Key not authorised to access this endpoint" }```

**Explanation:**  Your API key doesn't have permission to access this endpoint. Delta Exchange allows permission-based control for each key. There are two permissions given 1. Read Data ✅ 2. Trading ✅

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

**1. Check API Key Permissions**

- Go to API Management on Delta Exchange.  
- Verify respective permissions: 1. Read Data 2. Trading, are enabled ✅ or not.
- If required, create a new api key with the right permissions enabled ✅.

**2. Verify Endpoint Requirements**

- Market data: requires Read Data permissions only. 
- Orders, Positions, Wallets: requires Trading permission.

**3. Consider Security Best Practices**

- Grant only necessary permissions.  
- Use separate keys for different use-cases.


### IP Not Whitelisted Error

* ```{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "ip_not_whitelisted_for_api_key" } }```

**Explanation:**  This occurs when the request originates from an IP not allowed for the given API key. Delta Exchange enforces IP whitelisting as a security measure. Consider whitelisting he IP returned into the api error response.

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

**1. Update IP Whitelist**

- Log into Delta Exchange > API Management  
- Add your IP to the API key’s whitelist. The IP can be found into the api error response. 
- You can whitelist a list of IPs too. Enter them as comma separated list.
- Delta support both IPv4 and IPv6 formats for whitelisting.

**2. Consider Network Behavior**

- VPNs or ISPs with dynamic IPs may require frequent updates.  
- Consider cloud hosted machine with static IP for production to avoid whitelisting repeatedly.

### Request Forbidden Error

* ```{ "error": "Forbidden", "message": "Request blocked by CDN" } ```

**Explanation:**  Your request was blocked before reaching the Delta API gateway. This usually happens when required headers are missing (e.g., User-Agent), or when requests originate from environments where the IP is hidden or blocked by the CDN.

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

**1. Add a User-Agent Manually**

- Some HTTP clients (e.g., in certain programming languages) do not send a User-Agent header by default.
- Set a valid User-Agent string in your request to avoid being rejected.

**2. Trace Request Headers**

- Inspect the request/response headers using tools like curl -v, Postman, or your language’s HTTP client debugger.
- Check if required headers are present and correctly passed through.

**3. Verify Request IP**

- Some hosted environments or proxies mask the client IP.
- Confirm that the request includes a valid IP address visible to the CDN. If the IP is hidden or blocked, the request will be rejected.

### Signature Mismatch Error

* ```{ "success": false, "error": { "code": "Signature Mismatch" } }```

**Explanation:**  This error occurs when the signature generated on your end does not match the one received by Delta Exchange. This can happen due to incorrect timestamp, payload, or method used in the signature generation.

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

**1. Verify Signature Generation**

- Ensure you are using the correct http method (GET/POST) and the same payload as in the request.
- Check that the timestamp used in the signature matches the one sent in the request.
- Ensure you are using the correct API secret for the signature generation.
- Make sure you are using the correct endpoint path and query parameters in the signature generation.
- Ensure that the payload is properly formatted and matches the request body.
- Check for any extra spaces or characters in the signature string.
- Refer to the sample code block (see [Signing a Message](/#signing-a-message)).

By following these troubleshooting steps, you can resolve common Delta Exchange API authentication and authorization issues. For persistent problems, contact Delta Exchange support.

(Note - **api key creation blocked - When user enters wrong otp/mfa code more than 5 times, Delta exchange blocks api key creation for next 30 mins. After then, users can try creating again.**)


## Generating an API Key

Before being able to sign any requests, you must create an API key via the Delta website. Upon creating a key you will receive api key and api secret, which you must remember and secure at your end. The Key and Secret will be randomly generated.

You can create a new API key from here :
[https://www.delta.exchange/app/account/manageapikeys](https://www.delta.exchange/app/account/manageapikeys)

To create an API key with Trading permissions, whitelisted IP(s) must be provided. API requests using this API key will only succeed, if made from a machine with an IP address that was whitelisted. Multiple IPs can be whitelisted for a single API key. IP values can take IPv4 and IPv6. Whitelisted IPs can be changed and updated from the same page.

Common issues:  
1. Your machine is using IPv6 instead of IPv4 or vice-versa. Disable the one that isn’t whitelisted from your network settings or whitelist both.  
2. Your ISP may automatically change the IP address at your home, office about once a week. Update your whitelisted IP in such case.  
3. If you are using a Web Service/Cloud provider like AWS, assign a static public IPv4 address to your machine.  

## API Key Permissions

You can restrict the functionality of API keys. Before creating the key, you must choose what permissions you would like the key to have. The permissions are:

- Trading - Allow a key to have trading permissions. This includes placing new orders, cancelling orders, closing positions, changing margin & leverage.


## Creating a Request

All Authenticated requests must contain the following headers:

**api-key**: The api key as a string.

**signature**: The hex-encoded signature (see [Signing a Message](/#signing-a-message)).

**timestamp**: A timestamp for your request.

**User-Agent**: Your programming language or library that you are using. e.g. "python-3.10" or "java". This is for our internal stats, this header must be sent to avoid 4XX error.


All request bodies should have content type application/json and be valid JSON.

## Signing a Message

The signature header is generated by creating a sha256 HMAC using the secret key on the prehash string **method + timestamp + requestPath + query params + body** (where + represents string concatenation) and convert output to hexdigest. The timestamp value is the same as the 'timestamp' header.

**Signature created in the last 5 seconds is allowed. if signature reaches delta system post 5 seconds of generation, then it will fail.**

# GET /orders
# queryString: product_id=1&state=open

# Generating signature:
echo -n "GET1542110948/v2/orders?product_id=1&state=open" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "7b6f39dcf660ec1c7c664f612c60410a2bd0c258416b498bf0311f94228f"

#  api-key: a207900b7693435a8fa9230a38195d
  #timestamp: 1542110948

```

```python
import hashlib
import hmac
import requests
import time

base_url = 'https://api.india.delta.exchange'
api_key = 'a207900b7693435a8fa9230a38195d'

```

# Rate Limits

When a rate limit is exceeded, a HTTP response status 429 Too Many Requests will be returned.
'X-RATE-LIMIT-RESET' is returned in response header with time left in milliseconds after which next API request can be hit. 

We throttle unauthenticated api requests by IP address and authenticated requests by user ID. 

Default Quota is 20000 for a fixed 5 minute window. Rate Limit quota resets to full every 5 mins.

## API & product rate limits

### REST API 
Every REST endpoint has been assigned a weight. When you make an API call, the weight of that endpoint is deducted from your 5 min window quota. Exceeding the rate limit quota, results in 429 HTTP response status error. API endpoints related to reading public data are lighter in weight, whereas API endpoints related to writing private data (like placing an order) are heavier in weight. 

Here is the cost structure for various endpoints. Please note that any endpoint not mentioned here has a cost of 1 unit.

Weight Slab|API Endpoints
--|--
3| Get Products, Get Orderbook, Get Tickers, Get Open Orders, Get Open Postions, Get Balances, OHLC Candles
5| Place/Edit/Delete Order, Add Position Margin
10| Get Order History, Get Fills, Get Txn Logs
25| Batch Order Apis

e.g. Consider making all the below requests in a 5 minute window.  
100 Get Open Orders requests = 100 * 3 = 300 weight.  
50 Get Balances requests = 50 * 3 = 150 weight.  
200 Place order requests = 200 * 5 = 1000 weight.  
20 Batch Order requests = 20 * 25 = 500 weight.  
Total quota used: 300 + 150 + 1000 + 500 = 1950 quota used. If this is greater than quota assigned to you, rate limit error will occur.

### Product
We have also introduced rate limits to manage operations within the matching engine. The current rate limit is set at 500 operations per second for each product. For example, placing 50 orders in a batch counts as 50 operations, as each individual order will be processed by the matching engine.

This measure is in place to prevent excessive operations on the matching engine, which could slow down its performance.

Even if you have not exceeded the rate limit on the REST API level, your requests may still fail with a 429 error if you breach the product-level rate limit.

## Increasing your rate limits

If you are running up against our limits and believe that you have a legitimate need, please email us at [support@delta.exchange](mailto:support@delta.exchange) to discuss increasing your rate limits.

# System Status

This is a public websocket channel that provides updates on system-wide status events such as scheduled maintenance, maintenance start and finish, degraded mode, and fallback operation. No symbols are required when subscribing to this channel. For more details, click on System Status to be redirected to the maintenance page (see [System Status](/#system_status)).
# Types
## Timestamps

Unless otherwise specified, all timestamps from API are returned in  [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)  with microseconds. Make sure you can parse the following ISO 8601 format. Most modern languages and libraries will handle this without issues.

```
2019-09-18T10:41:20Z

```

## Numbers

Big Decimal numbers are returned as strings to save full precision. When making a API request, it is suggested to convert numbers to strings to avoid truncation and precision errors.

e.g. Limit price, stop loss price, trail_amount

Integer numbers (like contract size, product_id and impact size) are unquoted.

## IDs

Most identifiers are big integers unless otherwise specified. When making a request that requires an ID, ensure it is passed as a numeric value without formatting changes. When making a request which requires a UUID, both forms (with and without dashes) are accepted.

`167ja7cg-678e-6876-d6g3-f803ce49qsc9`  or  `167ja7cg678e6876d6g3f803ce49qsc9`


# Response Formats
To ensure that you are effectively using the api, we encourage you to go through this section. 

1. All responses coming from the server, either from rest api or socket rpc calls will have the following success and error formats.
2. All timestamps reported in the apis will be in microseconds
3. All big decimal values are sent as string


```json
// The new format supports sending meta data alongside response body. 
// Success format
{
  "success": true,
  "result": {},         // response body
  "meta": {
    "after": "...",       // cursor for pagination, is returned in meta
    "before": null,
  },
}

// Error Format
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "insufficient_margin",             // error code
    "context": {                              // error context
      "additional_margin_required": "0.121"
    }
  }
}
```

# Spot Trading

Delta Exchange also offers Spot markets, where supported cryptocurrencies are traded directly against INR.

Spot uses the same REST endpoints, WebSocket channels, and authentication as the rest of the API. There are no separate Spot endpoints and no additional auth requirements — to trade Spot, point an existing call at a Spot product.

| Asset | Symbol |
| --- | --- |
| Bitcoin | `BTC_INR` |
| Ethereum | `ETH_INR` |
| Solana | `SOL_INR` |
| XRP | `XRP_INR` |

New markets are added over time. Fetch the current list from `/v2/products`:

`curl -X GET "https://api.india.delta.exchange/v2/products?contract_types=spot&states=live" -H "Accept: application/json"`

```

The Delta Exchange MCP server exposes this API to AI agents over the Model Context Protocol. It runs as a local stdio subprocess and turns agent tool calls into signed REST requests. An agent reads market data, checks an account and places orders without writing HTTP or signing code.

Install and run it with `uvx delta-exchange-mcp`. Its tools fall into three tiers:

| Category | API key | Permissions | What an agent can do |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Market data | Not required | — | Read the product catalog, tickers, order-book depth, recent trades and OHLC candles. Pull option chains, spot indices, settlement prices, and funding-rate, mark-price and open-interest history. |
| Account data | Required | Read permission | Read open positions with size, entry and unrealized PnL. Read balances, the wallet ledger, active and past orders, own fills, leverage and account preferences. Export fills to CSV. |
| Trading | Required | Trading permission + `DELTA_MCP_MODE=trade` | Place, edit and cancel single orders, batches of up to 50 on one contract, and take-profit/stop-loss brackets. Set leverage, adjust isolated margin, close all positions. |

Every tool is a read-only `GET` by default. The trading tools register only when you set `DELTA_MCP_MODE=trade` and supply an API key with trading permissions.

Once connected, ask the agent in plain language:

- "What is my unrealized PnL on BTCUSD?"
- "Show the BTC option chain expiring this Friday."
- "Cancel my open orders on ETHUSD." (trade mode only)

For setup, the full tool reference and key permissions, see [mcp.delta.exchange/docs](https://mcp.delta.exchange/docs).

Placing Orders, Cancelling Orders, Placing batch orders, Cancelling batch orders, Get Open orders, Change Orders Leverage. Rate limits have been introduced recently that allows only set number of operations inside a matching engine in a timeframe. The current rate limits is 500 operations/sec for each product. For ex - placing 50 orders in a batch is equivalent to 50 operations as these orders will be processed by matching engine. Rate limits do not apply when cancelling orders.

# Deadman Switch

The Deadman Switch is a safety mechanism that automatically cancels orders or takes other protective actions when a client fails to send heartbeat signals within specified time intervals. This feature is essential for risk management and preventing unwanted positions from accumulating due to client disconnections or failures.

## Overview

The Deadman Switch system consists of several components:

- **Heartbeat Creation**: Clients register a heartbeat with specific configuration
- **Heartbeat Acknowledgment**: Clients periodically send acknowledgments to keep the heartbeat alive
- **Automatic Actions**: When heartbeats expire, the system automatically executes configured actions

## Authentication

All Deadman Switch endpoints require authentication. Include your API key and signature in the request headers as described in the [Authentication](#authentication) section.

## Heartbeat Management

### Create Heartbeat

Creates a new heartbeat with specific configuration for automatic actions.

**Endpoint:** `POST /heartbeat/create`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "heartbeat_id": "my_trading_bot_001",
  "impact": "contracts",
  "contract_types": ["perpetual_futures", "call_options"],
  "underlying_assets": ["BTC", "ETH"],
  "product_symbols": ["BTCUSD", "ETHUSD"],
  "config": [
    {
      "action": "cancel_orders",
      "unhealthy_count": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "spreads",
      "unhealthy_count": 3,
      "value": 100
    }
  ]
}
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `heartbeat_id` | string | Yes | Unique identifier for the heartbeat |
| `impact` | string | Yes | Impact : `contracts`, `products` |
| `contract_types` | array | Yes | Array of contract types to monitor, required if impact is contracts |
| `underlying_assets` | array | No | Array of underlying assets to monitor |
| `product_symbols` | array | Yes | Array of specific product symbols to monitor, required if impact is products |
| `config` | array | Yes | Array of action configurations |

**Config Actions:**

- `cancel_orders`: Cancels all open orders
- `spreads`: Adds spreads to orders

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    "heartbeat_id": "my_trading_bot_001"
  }
}
```

### Heartbeat Acknowledgment

Sends an acknowledgment to keep the heartbeat active. Set ttl to 0 to disable heartbeat. 

**Endpoint:** `POST /heartbeat`

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "heartbeat_id": "my_trading_bot_001",
  "ttl": 30000
}
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `heartbeat_id` | string | Yes | Heartbeat identifier |
| `ttl` | integer/string | Yes | Time to live in milliseconds |

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    "heartbeat_timestamp": "1243453435", //next expiry timestamp
    "process_enabled": "true" // true/false
  }
}
```

### Get Heartbeats

Retrieves all active heartbeats for a user.

**Endpoint:** `GET /heartbeat`

**Query Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `heartbeat_id` | string | No | Specific heartbeat ID to retrieve |

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": [
    {
      "user_id": "user_id",
      "heartbeat_id": "my_trading_bot_001",
      "impact": "contracts",
      "contract_types": ["perpetual_futures", "call_options"],
      "underlying_assets": ["BTC", "ETH"],
      "product_symbols": ["BTCUSD", "ETHUSD"],
      "config": [
        {
          "action": "cancel_orders",
          "unhealthy_count": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Best Practices

1. **Regular Heartbeats**: Send heartbeat acknowledgments at regular intervals (recommended: every 30 seconds)
2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for heartbeat failures
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor heartbeat status and implement alerts for failures
4. **Graceful Shutdown**: Properly disable heartbeats when shutting down trading systems

### Python Example

```python
import requests
import time
import json

            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Heartbeat failed: {e}")

            "api-key": self.api_key,
            # Add signature generation logic
        }

# Usage example
deadman = DeadmanSwitch("your_api_key", "your_api_secret", "https://api.delta.exchange")
deadman.create_heartbeat()
deadman.start_heartbeat_loop()

```

## Error Codes

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `unauthorized` | Authentication failed |
| `rate_limit_exceeded` | Too many requests |

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Security**: Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code
2. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS for all API communications
3. **Monitoring**: Implement proper monitoring and alerting for heartbeat failures
4. **Backup Systems**: Consider implementing backup heartbeat mechanisms for critical trading systems

# Rest Clients

Delta API conforms to the Swagger spec for REST endpoints. Any Swagger-compatible client can connect to the Delta API and execute commands.

You can find the swagger spec json for Delta Api [here]
(https://docs.delta.exchange/api/swagger_v2.json)

We also have Rest Api Clients available for the following languages

- [Nodejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/delta-rest-client)
- [Python](https://pypi.org/project/delta-rest-client)


## CCXT
CCXT is our authorized SDK provider and you may access our API through CCXT.

When initializing the exchange, set the `urls` config to point to the Delta API base URL.

```python
import ccxt

# Replace with your actual API keys
api_key = 'API_KEY'
api_secret = 'API_SECRET'

# Initialize exchange
exchange = ccxt.delta({
    'apiKey': api_key,
    'secret': api_secret,
    'enableRateLimit': True,
    'urls': {
        'api': {
            'public': 'https://api.india.delta.exchange',
            'private': 'https://api.india.delta.exchange',
        }
    }
})

# Load markets
exchange.load_markets()
```

For more information, please visit [ccxt website](https://ccxt.trade).


# Websocket Feed

Websocket api can be used for the following use cases

- Get real time feed of market data, _pricethis includes L2 orderbook and recent trades.
- Get price feeds - Mark prices of different contracts, price feed of underlying indexes etc.
- Get account specific notifications like fills, liquidations, [ADL](https://guides.delta.exchange/delta-exchange-india-user-guide) and PnL updates.
- Get account specific updates on orders, positions and wallets.

Websocket url for [Delta Exchange](https://www.delta.exchange)

<ul>
<li><strong>Production private channel endpoint</strong> - wss://socket.india.delta.exchange</li>
<li><strong>Production public channel endpoint</strong> - wss://public-socket.india.delta.exchange</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Testnet(Demo Account) private channel endpoint</strong> - wss://socket-ind.testnet.deltaex.org</li>
<li><strong>Testnet(Demo Account) public channel endpoint</strong> - wss://socket-ind-pub.testnet.deltaex.org</li>
</ul>

There is a limit of 150 connections every 5 minutes per IP address. A connection attempt that goes beyond the limit will be disconnected with 429 HTTP status error. On receiving this error, wait for 5 to 10 minutes before making new connection requests.

You will be disconnected, if there is no activity within **60 seconds** after making connection.

# Subscribing to Channels

## Subscribe

To begin receiving feed messages, you must first send a subscribe message to the server indicating which channels and contracts to subscribe for.

To specify contracts within each channel, just pass a list of symbols inside the channel payload. Mention ***["all"]*** in symbols if you want to receive updates across all the contracts. Please note that snapshots are sent only for specified symbols,meaning no snapshots are sent for symbol: ***"all"***.

Once a subscribe message is received the server will respond with a subscriptions message that lists all channels you are subscribed to. Subsequent subscribe messages will add to the list of subscriptions. 

> Subscription Sample

```json
// Request: Subscribe to BTCUSD and ETHUSD with the ticker and orderbook(L2) channels.
{
    "type": "subscribe",
    "payload": {
        "channels": [
            {
                "name": "v2/ticker",
                "symbols": [
                    "BTCUSD",
                    "ETHUSD"
                ]
            },
            {
                "name": "l2_orderbook",
                "symbols": [
                    "BTCUSD"
                ]
            },
            {
                "name": "funding_rate",
                "symbols": [
                    "all"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}

// Response: Success
{
    "type": "subscriptions",
    "channels": [
        {
            "name": "l2_orderbook",
            "symbols": [
                "BTCUSD"
            ],
        },
        {
            "name": "v2/ticker",
            "symbols": [
                "BTCUSD",
                "ETHUSD"
            ]
        },
        {
            "name": "funding_rate",
            "symbols": [
                "all"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

// Response: Error 
{
    "type": "subscriptions",
    "channels": [
        {
            "name": "l2_orderbook",
            "symbols": [
                "BTCUSD"
            ],
        },
        {
            "name": "trading_notifications",
            "error": "subscription forbidden on trading_notifications. Unauthorized user"
        }
    ]
}
```


## Unsubscribe

If you want to unsubscribe from channel/contracts pairs, send an "unsubscribe" message. The structure is equivalent to subscribe messages. If you want to unsubscribe for specific symbols in a channel, you can pass it in the symbol list. As a shorthand you can also provide no symbols for a channel, which will unsubscribe you from the channel entirely.

> Unsubscribe Sample

```json
// Request: Unbubscribe from BTCUSD and ETHUSD with the ticker and orderbook(L2) channels.
{
    "type": "unsubscribe",
    "payload": {
        "channels": [
            {
                "name": "v2/ticker",          // unsubscribe from ticker channel only for BTCUSD
                "symbols": [
                    "BTCUSD"
                ]
            },
            {
                "name": "l2_orderbook"      // unsubscribe from all symbols for l2_orderbook channel
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

# Authenticating

## Current method

Authentication allows clients to subscribe to user account related trading notifications using private channels like positions, orders, etc. This allows users to get real-time updates related to their orders, fills, liquidations, [adl](/#trading-notitifications) and pnl updates.

```python
# auth message with signed request
import websocket
import hashlib
import hmac
import time

api_key = 'a207900b7693435a8fa9230a38195d'
api_secret = '7b6f39dcf660ec1c7c664f612c60410a2bd0c258416b498bf0311f94228f'

def generate_signature(secret, message):
    message = bytes(message, 'utf-8')
    secret = bytes(secret, 'utf-8')
    hash = hmac.new(secret, message, hashlib.sha256)
    return hash.hexdigest()

# Get open orders
method = 'GET'
timestamp = str(int(time.time()))
path = '/live'
signature_data = method + timestamp + path
signature = generate_signature(api_secret, signature_data)

ws = websocket.WebSocketApp('wss://socket.india.delta.exchange')

ws.send(json.dumps({
    "type": "key-auth",
    "payload": {
        "api-key": api_key,
        "signature": signature,
        "timestamp": timestamp
    }
}))

ws.send(json.dumps({
    "type": 'unauth',
    "payload": {}
}))
```

**Note**: For users migrating from older authentication method, the change is: "type" in request payload must be changed from "auth" to "key-auth". Rest of the request payload will remain the same. The response payloads have major changes. Check below for the response payloads.  


To authenticate, you must send a request of type **'key-auth'** on your socket connection. Authentication request is a json of the format:  
`{"type":"key-auth","payload":{"api-key":"#KEY#","timestamp":#TIMESTAMP#,"signature":"#SIGNATURE#"}}`  
**KEY** here is your API-key string.  
**TIMESTAMP** is current epoch Unix timestamp in seconds as a number.  
**SIGNATURE** is hash string of HMAC created using `'GET' + string(TIMESTAMP) + '/live'` and your API-secret.  
Note: Same timestamp must be used for TIMESTAMP and in generating SIGNATURE. 

Refer to the right side for a sample code.

<br><br><br>

**Authentication Responses**  
All authentication responses will be json containing following keys:  
**"type"** will always be "key-auth"  
**"success"** is a boolean indicating whether the authentication was a success or failure.  
**"status_code"** is number just like HTTP response status.  
**"status"** is a string describing the response status.  
**"message"** is a string which may be present describing authentication failure reason.


Success response:  
`{"type":"key-auth", "success":true, "status_code":200, "status":"authenticated"}`


Error responses:  

1. Lacking 'api-key' or 'sign' or 'timestamp' in the payload:  
`{"type":"key-auth", "success":false, "status_code":400, "status":"incomplete_payload", "message":"Incomplete payload"}`  

2. Request received after 5 secs:   
`{"type":"key-auth", "success":false, "status_code":408, "status":"request_expired", "message":"Timestamp header outside of allowed time window"}}`  

3. ApiKey does not exist:  
`{"type":"key-auth", "success":false, "status_code":404, "status":"api_key_not_found", "message":"ApiKey not found"}}`  

4. Invalid/wrong Signature:  
`{"type":"key-auth", "success":false, "status_code":401, "status":"invalid_signature", "message":"Invalid Signature"}`  

5. IP address not whitelisted for the API-key:  
`{"type":"key-auth", "success":false, "status_code":401, "status":"ip_not_whitelisted", "message":"IP address not whitelisted. Your IP: 172.16.19.91"}`  

6. Some internal server error:  
`{"type":"key-auth", "success":false, "status_code":500, "status":"internal_server_error", "message": "Internal Server Error. Code: 1001"`


## Old method

Note: This method of authentication will stop working from 31st December 2025.

Authentication allows clients to receives private messages, like trading notifications. Examples of the trading notifications are: fills, liquidations, [adl](/#trading-notitifications) and pnl updates.

To authenticate, you need to send a signed request of type **'auth'** on your socket connection. Check the authentication section above for more details on how to sign a request using api key and secret.

The payload for the signed request will be ***'GET' + timestamp + '/live'***

To subscribe to private channels, the client needs to first send an auth event, providing api-key, and signature. 

To unsubscribe from all private channels, just send a **'unauth'** message on the socket. This will automatically unsubscribe the connection from all authenticated channels.


# Sample Python Code

## Public Channels

**Summary:** 
The python script(right panel) connects to the Delta Exchange WebSocket to receive real-time market data.

- It opens a connection.
- Subscribes to `ticker`(tickers data) and `candlestick_1m`(1 minute ohlc candlesticks) channels. (**MARK:BTCUSD** - mark price ohlc in candlesticks channel)
- When data arrives, it processes and prints it.
- If an error occurs, it prints an error message.
- If the connection closes, it notifies the user.
- The connection remains open indefinitely to keep receiving updates.

```python
import websocket
import json

# production websocket base url
WEBSOCKET_URL = "wss://socket.india.delta.exchange"

def on_error(ws, error):
    print(f"Socket Error: {error}")

def on_close(ws, close_status_code, close_msg):
    print(f"Socket closed with status: {close_status_code} and message: {close_msg}")

def on_open(ws):
  print(f"Socket opened")

## Private Channels

**Summary:** 
The python script(right panel) connects to the Delta Exchange WebSocket to receive real-time market data.

- It opens a connection.
- Sends authentication payload over socket with api_key, signature & timestamp.
- When authentication update arrives, it checks for success and then sends subscription for `orders` and `positions` channels for all contracts.
- Prints all other updates in json format.
- If an error occurs, it prints an error message.
- If the connection closes, it notifies the user.
- The connection remains open indefinitely to keep receiving updates.

# Detecting Connection Drops
Some client libraries might not detect connection drops properly. We provide two methods for the clients to ensure they are connected and getting subscribed data.

## Heartbeat (Recommended)
The client can enable heartbeat on the socket. If heartbeat is enabled, the server is expected to periodically send a heartbeat message to the client. Right now, the heartbeat time is set to 30 seconds. 

### How to Implement on client side

- Enable heartbeat (check sample code) after each successful socket connection
- Set a timer with duration of 35 seconds (We take 5 seconds buffer for heartbeat to arrive).
- When you receive a new heartbeat message, you reset the timer
- If the timer is called, that means the client didn't receive any heartbeat in last 35 seconds. In this case, the client should exit the existing connection and try to reconnect. 

```python
// Enable Heartbeat on successful connection
ws.send({
    "type": "enable_heartbeat"
})

// Disable Heartbeat
ws.send({
    "type": "disable_heartbeat"
})

// Sample Heartbeat message received periodically by client
{
    "type": "heartbeat"
}
```


## Ping/Pong
The client can periodically (~ every 30 seconds) send a ping frame or a raw ping message and the server will respond back with a pong frame or a raw pong response. If the client doesn't receive a pong response in next 5 seconds, the client should exit the existing connection and try to reconnect. 

```python
// Ping Request
ws.send({
    "type": "ping"
})

// Pong Response
ws.send({
    "type": "pong"
})
```

# Public Channels

## ticker
This channel is available on the new public api websocket endpoint.

**ticker** channel provides **price change data** for the last **24 hrs** (rolling window).  
It is published every **5 seconds**.

To subscribe to the ticker channel, you need to send the list of **symbols** for which you would like to receive updates.

You need to send the list of symbols for which you would like to subscribe to this channel. You can also subscribe to this channel for all symbols in an Option Chain. e.g. To subscribe to all Put and Call Options updates for BTC Options expiring on 31st March 2026, send symbol = "BTC-310326". ("ASSET-DDMMYY") 

**Important:**  
If you subscribe to the ticker channel without specifying a symbols list, you will **not** receive any data.

## ob_updates

This channel is available on the new public api websocket endpoint.

**ob_updates** channel provides initial snapshot and then incremental orderbook data. The frequency of updates may vary for different symbols. You can only subscribe to upto 100 symbols on a single connection. ob_updates channel does not accept product category names or "all" as valid symbols.
Please note that if you subscribe to ob_updates channel without specifying the symbols list, you will not receive any data.  
Publish interval: 100 millisecs  
"action"="update" messages wont be published till there is an orderbook change.

```json
//Subscribe

    "type": "subscribe",
    "payload": {
        "channels": [
            {

### How to maintain orderbook locally using this channel:

1) When you subscribe to this channel, the first message with "action"= "snapshot" resembles the complete orderbook at this time. json_key "a" (asks) and json_key "b" (bids) are arrays of ["price", "size"]. (size is number of contracts at this price)

2) After the initial snapshot, messages will be with "action" = "update", resembling the difference between current and previous orderbook state. "asks" and "bids" are arrays of ["price", "new size"]. "asks" are sorted in increasing order of price. "bids" are sorted in decreasing order of price. This is true for both "snapshot" and "update" messages.

3) "seq" (sequence_no) field must be used to check if any messages were dropped. "sequence_no" must be +1 of the last message.  
e.g. In the snapshot message it is 6199, and the update message has 6200. The next update message must have 6201. In case of sequence_no mismatch, resubscribe to the channel, and start from the beginning.

4) If sequence_no is correct, edit the in-memory orderbook using the "update" message.  
Case 1: price already exists, new size is 0 -> Delete this price level.  
Case 2: price already exists, new size isn't 0 -> Replace the old size with new size.  
Case 3: price doesn't exists -> insert the price level.  
e.g. for the shown snapshot and update messages to create the new orderbook: in the ask side, price level of "16919.0" will be deleted. Size at price level "16919.5" will be changed from "1193" to "710". In the bids side there was no price level of "16918.5", so add a new level of "16918.5" of size "304". Other price levels from the snapshot will remain the same.

5) If "action":"error" message is received, resubscribe this symbol after a few seconds. Can occur in rare cases, e.g. Failed to send "action":"snapshot" message after subscribing due to a race condition, instead an "error" message will be sent.

Checksum: Using this, users can verify the accuracy of orderbook data created using ob_updates. checksum is the "cs" key in the message payload.  
Steps to calculate checksum:  
1) Edit the old in-memory orderbook with the "update" message received.  
2) Create asks_string and bids_string as shown below. where priceN = price at Nth level, sizeN = size at Nth level. Asks are sorted in increasing order and bids in decreasing order by price.  
asks_string = price0:size0,price1:size1,…,price9:size9  
bids_string = price0:size0,price1:size1,…,price9:size9  
checksum_string = asks_string + "|" + bids_string  
Only consider the first 10 price levels on both sides. If orderbook as less than 10 levels, use only them.  
e.g. If after applying the update, the new orderbook becomes ->  
asks = [["100.00", "23"], ["100.05", "34"]]  
bids = [["99.04", "87"], ["98.65", "102"], ["98.30", "16"]]  
checksum_string = "100.00:23,100.05:34|99.04:87,98.65:102,98.30:16"  
3) Calculate the CRC32 value (32-bit unsigned integer) of checksum_string. This should be equal to the checksum provided in the "update" message.

### Market Disruption
When markets are disrupted, orderbook enters into cancel only mode. You can refer to "trading_status" field in product info to determine this. In cancel only mode, you can only cancel your orders. No matching happens in this mode.

### Auction Started
When markets need to come up, we conduct a single price auction. In this case, orderbook enters into post only mode. In post only mode, you can post new orders, cancel exisiting orders, add more margin to open positions. No matching happens in this mode. It is possible to see an overlap between asks and bids during this time.


### Auction Finished
When auction finishes, markets enter into operational mode and trading continues as usual. 

You can read more about the single price auction [here](https://www.delta.exchange/blog/bootstrapping-liquidity-using-auctions/)



## system_status

**Note:** This channel is now available on the new [public channel websocket endpoint](#websocket-feed). It will be deprecated from the [private channel websocket endpoint](#websocket-feed) on 31st July 2026.

This is a public websocket channel that provides updates on system-wide status events such as scheduled maintenance, maintenance start and finish, degraded mode, and fallback operation. No symbols are required when subscribing to this channel. Below are the types of messages sent for more details:

```

snapshot → This event is sent as soon as you subscribe to the system_status channel. The data in this event contains the current system status details.

1. "event": "maintenance_scheduled" is sent when maintenance is scheduled, usually 6 to 24 hours before the actual maintenance. It includes the estimated start and finish times.  
2. "event": "maintenance_started" is sent when maintenance begins. It indicates service disruption and includes the estimated finish time. For unscheduled maintenance, this event may be sent directly without the prior maintenance_scheduled event.  
3. "event": "maintenance_finished" is sent when maintenance is complete. Usually, after this event, there is an auction period lasting around 5 to 10 minutes.  
4. "event": "maintenance_cancelled" is sent when upcoming scheduled maintenance has been cancelled.

Note: Maintenance start and finish times are approximate estimates. The actual start time is confirmed by the maintenance_started event, and the actual completion is confirmed by the maintenance_finished event.

These values describe the current state of the entire system.

The payload["status"] describe the current state of the entire system. Below are the possible values:

1. "live": The system is operating normally. All services (REST APIs, WebSocket, backend processes) are functioning as expected.  
2. "maintenance": The system is currently under maintenance. Some features or services may be temporarily unavailable or disrupted.  
3. "api_fallback": Our system might be facing some technical issues, but most core functions remain available. Mostly used by our internal system. You can treat this as "live" mode, and check with our support team.  
4. "degraded_mode": Our system might be facing some technical issues, but most core functions remain available. Mostly used by our internal system. You can treat this as "live" mode, and check with our support team.  

Changing status to between these three: ["api_fallback", "degraded_mode", "live"] is done by sending message with 

"event":  "app_status_update".

e.g. payload = %{type: "system_status", event: "app_status_update", status: "api_fallback", maintenance_announcement_time: time, maintenance_start_time: time, maintenance_finish_time: time, timestamp: current_time}

Note: The "app_status_update" messages will still contain correct maintenance related timestamps.

In addition to the event field, the status field reflects the overall system state, such as: live, maintenance, api_fallback, or degraded_mode.
All timestamps are in epoch microseconds.

## Positions
This channel provides updates whenever there is any change in your open positions.

A snapshot of current open position will be sent after subscribing a symbol, incremental updates will be sent on trade executions.
You need to send the list of symbols for which you would like to subscribe to positions channel. You can also subscribe to positions 
updates for category of products by sending [category-names](/#schemaproductcategories). For example: to receive updates for put options and futures, refer this: `{"symbols": ["put_options", "futures"]}`.
If you would like to subscribe for all the listed contracts, pass: `{ "symbols": ["all"] }`.
Please note that if you subscribe to positions channel without specifying the symbols list, you will not receive any data.

## Orders
Channel provides updates when any order is updated for any action such as fill, quantity change. Need to pass list of product symbols while subscribing.

A snapshot of all open/pending orders will be sent after subscribing a symbol. And all incremental updates will be sent on create/update/delete of orders

All updates including snapshot will have incremental seq_id. seq_id is separate for each symbol.

Any of the following events can be tracked by the reason field in this channel

- fill
- stop_update
- stop_trigger
- stop_cancel
- liquidation
- self_trade


You need to send the list of symbols for which you would like to subscribe to orders channel. You can also subscribe to orders
updates for category of products by sending [category-names](/#schemaproductcategories). For example: to receive updates for put options and futures, refer this: `{"symbols": ["put_options", "futures"]}`.
If you would like to subscribe for all the listed contracts, pass: `{ "symbols": ["all"] }`.
Please note that if you subscribe to orders channel without specifying the symbols list, you will not receive any data.

## UserTrades
Please use "v2/user_trades" channel for better latency.

Channel provides updates for fills. Need to pass list of product symbols while subscribing.

All updates will have incremental seq_id. seq_id is separate for each symbol.

Auto Deleverage Liquidations of a position can be tracked by reason: "adl" in the user_trades channel.
You need to send the list of symbols for which you would like to subscribe to user trades channel. You can also subscribe to user trades
updates for category of products by sending [category-names](/#schemaproductcategories). For example: to receive updates for put options and futures, refer this: `{"symbols": ["put_options", "futures"]}`.

## v2/user_trades
Channel provides updates for fills. Need to pass list of product symbols while subscribing. This channel is similar to user_trades channel, only difference is that, it is faster than user_trades and doesn't contain commission data.

All updates will have incremental sequence_id. sequence_id is separate for each symbol, useful for identifying if any v2/user_trades messages were missed/dropped. The sequence_id will reset to 1 after our systems restart. (usually after maintainaince/market disruption).

Auto Deleverage Liquidations of a position can be tracked by reason: "adl".
Liquidation of a position can be tracked by reason: "liquidation".  
You need to send the list of symbols for which you would like to subscribe to v2/user_trades channel. You can also subscribe to v2/user_trades updates for category of products by sending [category-names](/#schemaproductcategories).

## PortfolioMargins
Channel provides updates for portfolio margin values of the selected sub-account. These updates are sent every 2 seconds. In case portfolio margin is not enabled on the selected sub-account, no updates will be sent on this channel.

For detailed description of portfolio margin please see [user guide](https://guides.delta.exchange/delta-exchange-india-user-guide/trading-guide/margin-explainer/portfolio-margin)

UCF: is unrealised cashflows of your portfolio. These are the cashflows (negative for outgoing and positive for incoming) that will take place if all the positions in your portfolio are closed at prevailing mark prices.

# Changelog

## 31.08.26
1. Clarified `client_order_id` parameter description across the Orders API (place order, batch create/edit/cancel, and order schemas) to explicitly state that it must be unique across all open orders of the user. This is a documentation update only — no API behaviour has changed.

## 19.08.26
1. **GET /v2/profile** will no longer be accessible using api keys from 19th August 2026. Requests to this endpoint will be rejected. Please update your integrations accordingly.

## 03.06.26
1. Updated `Update MMP config` and `MMP Trigger` descriptions by removing the note about reaching out to support for MMP access.

## 20.05.26
1. Added a **Description** column to all "Enumerated Values" tables in the REST API docs, so each value now has a clear explanation of what it means. Covers values like `side`, `order_type`, `state`, `transaction_type`, `mmp`, `time_in_force`, `resolution`, and more. Updated across Products, Orders, Positions, TradeHistory, Trades, Wallet, Heartbeat Management, Historical OHLC Candles/Sparklines, and the Schemas section. This is a documentation update only — no API behaviour has changed.

## 17.04.26
1. The following WebSocket channels have been migrated to the **new public WebSocket endpoint** (`wss://public-socket.india.delta.exchange`). The new channels provide the same data with a more compact response format. The old channels on the **legacy private endpoint** (`wss://socket.india.delta.exchange`) will continue to work but are planned to be deprecated and removed on **31st July 2026** — please update your integrations before that date.
The new channels are: [`mark_price`](#mark_price), [`candlesticks`](#candlesticks), [`spot_price`](#spot_price), [`funding_rate`](#funding_rate), [`system_status`](#system_status).

2. The following legacy WebSocket channels have been migrated to the **new public WebSocket endpoint** (`wss://public-socket.india.delta.exchange`). The old channels on the **legacy private endpoint** (`wss://socket.india.delta.exchange`) will continue to work but are planned to be deprecated and removed on **31st July 2026** — please update your integrations before that date.

| Removed Channel | New Channel |
|---|---|
| `l1_orderbook` | [`ob_l1`](#ob_l1) |
| `l2_orderbook` | [`ob_l2`](#ob_l2) |
| `l2_updates` | [`ob_updates`](#ob_updates) |
| `v2/ticker` | [`ticker`](#ticker) |
| `all_trades` | [`trades`](#trades) |
| `v2/spot_price` | [`spot_price`](#spot_price) |

## 15.04.26
1. Introduced validation changes for `limit_price` parameter:
   - Any value ≤ 0 will now be rejected
   - If `limit_price` is not required, remove field from payload or send it as `null`

Please update your integrations accordingly to avoid request failures.

## 13.01.26
1. Order History `GET /v2/orders/history` and Fills `GET /v2/fills` history APIs will no longer include the total field in pagination meta, these changes are now live. We are planning to change max page_size allowed for these API endpoints to be 50, higher values than 50 will return only 50 items. These changes will go live on 28th January 2026 (tentative).
2. Updated parameter descriptions for product_ids and ticker symbol to clarify comma-separated format with maximum 10 Product_ids/symbols. Affected APIs endpoints are `GET /v2/tickers/{symbol}`, `GET /v2/orders`, `GET/v2/positions/margined`, `GET /v2/orders/history`, and `GET /v2/fills`. These changes will go live on 28th January 2026 (tentative). Passing more than 10 product_ids/symbols will return HTTP 4xx error. By default, if the product_ids parameter is not provided, these APIs returns data for all products.

## 11.12.25
1. Added a new WebSocket system_status channel which includes maintenance events such as maintenance_scheduled, maintenance_started, maintenance_finished, and maintenance_cancelled, along with real-time system status updates (live, api_fallback, degraded_mode) and an initial snapshot event providing the current system state.
2. We will be deprecating the announcements channel on 28 February 2026. All maintenance-related updates will be migrated to and provided through the system_status channel.

## 08.10.25
1. Added new websocket authentication method, {"type":"key-auth"}, which includes new formats of request and responses.  
2. Previous websocket authentication method, {"type":"auth"}, is now marked as deprecated. This method will stop working after 31st December 2025, users are requested to migrate to the newer websocket authentication.
3. We will be deprecating support for historical candlestick OHLC resolution 7d, 2w and 30d from 18th October 2025. The REST API `/history/candles` and websocket public channel `candlesticks` will stop supporting these resolutions. These resolutions have been removed from the documentation.
4. 'client_order_id' parameter in all Orders API is now restricted to max 32 length. e.g. REST API `POST /orders` parameter 'client_order_id' can be max 32 length string.


## 01.06.25
1. Added reason:"liquidation" for v2/user_trades websocket channel. Updated documentation for the v2/user_trades channel.
2. Added Connection rate limit for websocket URL endpoint of 150 connections per IP address per 5 minutes. Updated this info under 'Websocket Info' tab.


## 21.03.25
1. Better documentation for Websocket public channel 'candlesticks', now clearly states even Mark Price candles can be fetched.
2. /positions REST API fixed documentation for query parameters.
3. Better documentation for Websocket public channel 'announcements'.


## 20.02.25
1. Removed Websocket RPC section. Use REST API endpoints with normal HTTP requests (RPC requests still work, it is recommended not to use them).
2. Fixed documentation: "User-Agent" header is necessary for authenticated HTTP requests.
3. Fixed documentation: Better examples and documentation under 'General Information', 'Authentication', etc tabs.
4. Created separate documentation site for Indian and Global site for easier understanding and better examples for both.


## 18.10.2024
1. Added clickable links to the corresponding API response json schemas under some API "Responses" table. Updated some schemas to match the response. (This is a documentation fix, no changes in API)
2. Added "Testnet-India" REST and Websocket host endpoints.
3. Changed "Rate Limits" description and added an example.


## 01.05.2024
1. Added "po" positions key in /v2/user_trades websocket private channel.
2. Removed "fok" type for orders, as they are no longer supported.


## V2 Rest Api
Our v2 Api is significantly faster than the v1 api. Our focus while rebuilding v2 Apis was on the following

1. Remove Api gateway overheads as much as possible.
2. Remove overheads due to deep nesting in response payload.
3. Better Api structure to query only required data.

> New Response Format

```json
// The new format supports sending meta data alongside response body. 
// Success format
{
  success: true,
  result: {}         // response body
  meta: {
    after: "...",       // cursor for pagination, is returned in meta
    before: null,
  },
}

// Error Format
{
  success: false,
  error: {
    code: :insufficient_margin,             // error code
    context: {                              // error context
      additional_margin_required: "0.121"
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Api changes
- We have completely removed nested product/asset payloads from live orders and live positions. This ensures the payload is light.
- Rate limiting now works on a fixed window instead of a rolling window.
- Ticker Api - now includes turnover in USD, mark price, spot price.
- Orderbook and trades are now returned in separate Apis.
- For supporting trading strategies which require latest positions, Now we have two different Apis to query position. 
  
  /v2/positions - returns only size and entry price. This should be used when you want to get the latest position, but dont need the margin dependent fields like liquidation price, bankruptcy price etc

  /v2/positions/margined - returns all fields including margin dependent fields. When the position is updated due to a fill, changes might take some time to reflect in this Api.

- All Apis that support pagination now use cursor based pagination, instead of fixed page size pagination. Check more details in our [python rest client docs](https://github.com/delta-exchange/python-rest-client)


## New Socket Channels
- Socket Api interface hasn't changed much in terms of connection management and authentication. 
- We have deprecated old channels and created new channels which make integration easier. 
- To support easy management of live data, all private data channels now support initial snapshots and sequence numbers.

### List of new public channels
- v2/ticker - now includes turnover in USD, mark price, spot price
- candlesticks - subscribe to ohlc candle updates for different resolutions
- all_trades - subscribe to all public trades for a symbol

### List of new private channels
- orders - subscribe to lifecycle of live orders
- user_trades - subscribe to live user trades/fills feed
- positions - subscribe to position updates
- margins - get margin/wallet updates
